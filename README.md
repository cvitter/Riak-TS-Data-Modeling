# Riak TS - Data Modeling Basics Introduction

**Riak TS** (http://docs.basho.com/riak/ts) is a distributed NoSQL database optimized for time series use cases. Although Riak TS is based on Riak KV (http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv), you interact with Riak TS via tables, rows, and columns. This wiki will walk you through the basics of Riak TS data modeling and then move on to providing practical guidance on how to model for a variety of common use cases.

**Note**: Having a running instance of Riak TS when reading through these documents will be useful if you want to get hands on experience with data modeling and querying Riak TS. If you haven't already installed Riak TS please see [Installing Riak TS](Installing Riak TS.md) before proceeding.

If you are new to Riak TS I would suggest reading each of the following sections in order as the concepts build on each other to give you both a theoretical and practical understanding of best practices around data modeling:

* [Data Modeling Basics](Data Modeling Basics.md)
* [How Partition Keys Work](How Partition Keys Work.md)
